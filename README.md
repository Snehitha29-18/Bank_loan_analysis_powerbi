### Interactive Financial Loan Performance, Risk Segmentation & Insights

This project analyzes a bank’s loan dataset to understand borrower behavior, identify high-risk loans, and track overall loan performance. Using Power BI, I transformed raw financial data into an interactive dashboard that highlights key KPIs, loan status, customer segments, and repayment patterns.



## ✅ Project Objective

To build a complete loan analytics dashboard that helps financial teams monitor **loan performance, default risk, borrower profile, and payment behavior** using Power BI.


## 📁 **Dataset Overview**

The dataset includes borrower and loan details such as:

* Loan Amount, Interest Rate, Installments
* Loan Status (Fully Paid / Charged Off / Current)
* Employment Length & Job Title
* Annual Income, DTI (Debt-to-Income)
* Issue Date, Last Payment Date, Next Payment Date
* Home Ownership, Grade & Sub-grade
* Total Payment, Total Accounts

## 🛠️ **Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query)**

Using **Power Query Editor**, I performed:
✔ Removal of duplicates
✔ Handling missing values (emp title, income, dates)
✔ Standardizing text and date formats
✔ Creating calculated columns:

## 📌 **Key KPIs Created**

* Total Loans Issued
* Total Loan Amount
* Fully Paid Loans

* Average Interest Rate
* Total Interest Earned

All KPIs were built using **DAX measures** for accurate financial analysis.

## 💡 **Tools & Technologies**
